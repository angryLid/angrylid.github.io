# How I Rate Animated Shows

No Score/Unrated. Most animated shows fall into this category. After a quick look at the plot summary, reviews, and the average score, I simply have no desire to watch them.

0 Points. These are the shows I watched a part of, but found I truly had no interest and couldn't finish.

1 Point. These are the ones I could manage to finish. However, I generally wouldn't watch them again or recommend them to others.

2 Points. Shows that reach this level are what I consider good animated shows.

3 Points. These are very good animated shows. They usually have some flaws, so they are still a bit far from being a masterpiece. These are also typically the kind of work that veteran otakus would appreciate and acknowledge.

4 Points. This is the near-masterpiece level. Shows at this level are often phenomenal works. In other words, the best and most talked-about works of the year.

5 Points. Masterpiece. Since I thought up this rating system, I haven't seen a show that has reached this level yet. But works from before, like Tom and Jerry and Doraemon, should definitely be placed here.
