# Will Bitcoin Become an "Old Guard" Asset?

### 1. 2025: Gold Wins, Bitcoin Struggles
In 2025, we saw a clear split in the market. **Gold** had an amazing year. It started at around $2,100 per ounce and broke the **$4,000** mark in October. Its price rose more than **45%** in one year, hitting new records many times.

On the other hand, **Bitcoin** was weak in 2025. Although it touched $100,000 early in the year, it soon started to fall and stay low. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin actually **dropped by about 17%**. This shows that during a year of global uncertainty, most people chose real gold over digital coins.

### 2. "Natural Choice" vs. "Human Design"
The biggest difference between gold and Bitcoin is how they started: **Gold was "chosen" by history, but Bitcoin was "designed" by people.**

Gold became valuable over thousands of years because of its natural physical properties. **Since Bitcoin is a human design, it can always be replaced by a "better design."** In my opinion, the "halving every four years" rule is not a perfect idea, but a mistake. Gold production is very steady (growing only about 1% in 2025), which gives every generation a fair chance to buy in. But Bitcoin’s design allowed early owners to take most of the coins very quickly. This makes it feel "unfair" to younger people and hurts long-term trust.

### 3. The "Old Guard" Risk: Can Bitcoin Keep Up?
In internet culture, things like old tea, stamps, or jade are called **"Old Guard Assets."** This means older people think they are treasures, but young people think they are useless or even a "scam."

Bitcoin is starting to look like this. **Bitcoin and Blockchain were born at the same time, but Bitcoin might not keep up with the growth of Blockchain technology.** While Blockchain might be used everywhere in the future, Bitcoin itself might lose its energy. It is very hard to change Bitcoin's rules without breaking it, which makes it feel like a "digital stamp" in an old collection.

### 4. My Suggestion: A "Stock Split" Like Dogecoin
To make it easier for young people to buy in, I suggest a change to make Bitcoin feel "cheaper."

The price of 1 BTC is so high that many young people feel they can never own it. **I suggest changing the total supply from 21 million to 21 billion, or using a new unit like 1 Bitcoin = 1,000 Bitpennies.** This is like a "stock split" in the stock market. By making the price of one unit lower, it might reduce the bad feelings young people have toward Bitcoin.

### 5. Conclusion: A Safety Bet
**Disclaimer: This is not investment advice.**

Even though I criticize Bitcoin’s design, I still think it is the most important coin to hold for a long time. I will keep buying when the price is low until I reach my goal of 0.1 BTC.

Look at the numbers: By the end of 2025, **the total value of all Gold was over $20 trillion**, while **Bitcoin was only about $2 trillion**. If Bitcoin can ever become as big as Gold, its price can still grow by **8 to 10 times**. If that happens, 0.1 BTC will be a great safety net. But if Bitcoin eventually fails and disappears, then it won't matter how many you have.
